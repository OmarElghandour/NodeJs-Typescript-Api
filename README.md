Features
TypeScript type checking: With TypeScript, you can catch bugs before you even run your code. The TypeScript compiler checks your code for type-related issues and shows you any errors that it finds.

Strongly-typed objects: TypeScript allows you to define the structure of an object with interfaces, making it easy to ensure that you are always working with valid data.

Classes and inheritance: Use classes and inheritance to organize and reuse your code. TypeScript's class syntax is similar to that of other languages, making it easy for developers who are familiar with languages like Java or C# to pick up.

Decorators: Decorators are a feature of TypeScript that allows you to attach additional behavior to a class, method, or property. They are a powerful tool for extending the functionality of your code in a declarative way.
